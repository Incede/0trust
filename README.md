# ZeroTrust

0trust is a pure (completely on-chain) decentralized exchange to trade EOS based assets.

It has a efficient order matching algorithm which runs completely on-chain so the users
can be sure that there is no manipulation happening with their orders.

Balanced Binary Trees are used for fast and low fees order matching.

The matching happens on a price-time based priority.
